# Capstone-project : Predicting Insurance Costs with Regression Models
## Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting **health insurance costs** using regression analysis based on clinical indicators and lifestyle-related health data.  
Key variables included **weight, cholesterol level, glucose level, physical activities, and medical history**.  

The goal was to identify significant cost drivers, compare regression models, and support healthcare insurers in **cost estimation and risk assessment**.  

## Skills & Tools  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)  
- Regression Models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Ensemble Methods)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Correlation Analysis  
- Model Evaluation: RMSE, RÂ², Residual Analysis  

## Key Highlights  
- Conducted **EDA and correlation analysis** to identify major cost drivers  
- Built and compared multiple **regression models** (Linear, Decision Tree, XGBoost)  
- Applied **GridSearchCV** for model tuning and performance optimization  
- Evaluated models using error metrics and residual plots  

## Results & Learnings  
- **Weight and cholesterol level** showed strong correlation with insurance costs  
- **XGBoost model** provided the most accurate predictions among all models  
- Residual analysis indicated non-linearity and heteroscedasticity, suggesting further improvement with advanced ensemble methods  
- Insights highlight the **potential of data-driven approaches in healthcare pricing**  

## Business Impact  
- Supports **risk-adjusted pricing decisions** for healthcare insurers  
- Improves **accuracy in insurance cost estimation**  
- Demonstrates how ML can be applied to **healthcare analytics**
